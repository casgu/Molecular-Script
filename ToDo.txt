[x] fix zero devision can happen in somes normal cases
[x] Separate compression / expansion stiffness
[x] Link tension ( bigger or smaller than when is created )
[x] Max links per particles option
[x] Bake when finish option
[x] start render when finish option
[x] Free the memory when finish or stopped
[x] Max velocity info to give some keys on how much substeps needed
[x] Multithread kdtree searching
[x] Multithread kdtree creation
[x] Link search distance relative to particles size option
[x] Time scale instead of FPS
[x] Fix UI bug when object without pSystem are selected.
[x] Print: new links at this frames , total links from beginning and links broken
[x] Fix bug when mass by density is not check
[x] Fix more than 24hours estimating time issue
[ ] Support links length on randomly sized particles.
[x] Fix memory crash issues.
[x] Add collision "damping".
[ ] Make broken links with particles penetrating don't explode.

[wip] ***Deeper profiling before doing in the list below***
[ ] detect INF value in location and velocity
[ ] Try to see if I can send info of particles by memory adress to gain speed (like Mohamed does for it's mesher addon)
[wip] Optimisation in the code ( kdtree search and creation take most of the time when profiling )
[ ] clean and comments the code
[x] Multithread particles collisions and links solving
[ ] Optimize my own quicksort to stop when median is find
[ ] make particles not born or dead don't be calculated in kdtree
[ ] optimize links searching by puting dead links at the end of array and calloc them when iteration finish
[ ] Make link exponent work more propertly
